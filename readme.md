Jumpage
========
This is just another minimalistic page that you can use when you hit ctrl + t or cmd + t and its basic purpose is to help u move to ur most favourite sites quickly.

I built it up on the philosophy that there are always these select sites that everyone visits and jumpage helps you to get to those websites faster :)

So, what should i do ?
----------------------------
1. Download the entire thing
2. Open up index.html in your fav-est code editor
3. Edit away :) Its pretty self explanatory.

Uhm, How do i use it ? 
------------------------
If you're using firefox , get [this][firefoxaddon] addon

If you're using chrome , get [this][chromeaddon] extension

Change your new tab page , and you're good to go!
